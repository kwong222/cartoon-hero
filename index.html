		<h2>About Spider-Man</h2>
		<p>Spider-man is one of the best superheroes in Marvel Comics, who has fought numerous bad guys. He is a very relatable character and has spider-powers, like climbing up walls, super-strength, and he invented web-shooters that shoot artificial webs. Spider-man's secret identity is Peter Parker. He let a thief go past him when he was trying to make some money, because he couldn't be bothered to catch the thief. However, the thief ended up killing his uncle Ben. He fights crime for that reason, and his motto is: with great power, there must also come great responsibility, a quote that is often written wrongly.</p>
